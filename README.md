**Project Title: Pokémon Memory Card Game (React + TypeScript + Tailwind)**

This project is a web-based Pokémon Memory Card Game developed using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The application fetches Pokémon data dynamically from the PokéAPI and displays the cards in a randomized layout. The objective of the game is to test the user's memory by selecting unique Pokémon cards without clicking the same card more than once. Each correct selection increases the current score, while selecting a previously clicked card resets the score and ends the game. The application also tracks and displays the highest score achieved during the session.

The project is designed using modern frontend development practices, including component-based architecture, custom React hooks for game logic and API handling, TypeScript for type safety, and utility functions for card shuffling and state management. The folder structure follows a scalable and maintainable pattern separating UI components, business logic, API layer, and type definitions.

This project demonstrates skills in React development, TypeScript integration, API handling, state management, game logic implementation, and responsive UI design using Tailwind CSS.
